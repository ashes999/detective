# Detective

An experimental educational game that teaches critical thinking, problem solving, attention to detail, forensics.

Crafted in RPG Maker VX Ace with @silatsaif. Goals are to teach, in order:

- **Critical Thinking and Problem Solving:** Given a bunch of data about a case, figure out what's right and what's wrong; work out the picture of what really happened.
- **Detail Orientation:** small details matter. You should need to pay attention to figure out everything (eg. looking at items to find the bloodied one)
- **Forensic Sciences:** Teach the real stuff, not how they portray it on TV. Eg. you may have three ways to sample blood for DNA and find out whose it is, but the trade-off is speed vs. accuracy.
