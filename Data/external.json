# Stuff you can tweak. Tweak them one at a time, test a few new games, then keep.
# This way, if you break something, it's easy to isolate where/what.

# NOTE: changes to this file are reflected immediately, albeit most of it is used
# at the time you generate a new game; so you can save, and create a new game,
# and you should see your changes immediately.
